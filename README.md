My personal portfolio, remade in NextJs

[Hosted](https://pnbakken.netlify.app/) on Netlify

## Description

A near identical copy of my existing portfolio, stuffed into NextJS. I had mostly finished work on the site at the beginning of summer 22, so this was a way to have something to do for the final two weeks of studies beyond writing readmes. The markup is directly copied from the old version. I've split things off into components as necessary, and interactive functions have been refactored to use react states and effects. Currently does not make good use of either Next or React; it does nothing that the old version didn't already do. I imagine I'll want to improve the website at a later point, and stuffing it into a framework seems like sensible groundwork. I also have TypeScript support for this reason, even though there's only the required minimum of type setting for now.
